## Introduction

This repository is a collection of C++ code for various data structures and algorithms. The implementations are written in a way to be both efficient and easy to understand. It is meant for educational and practice purposes.

## Data Structures

- [Array]
- [Linked List]
- [Stack]
- [Queue]
- [Binary Search Tree]
- ...

## Algorithms

- [Sorting]
- [Searching]
- [Recursion]
- [Dynamic Programming]
- [Graph Algorithms]
- ...

## How to Use

Each data structure and algorithm is contained in its own file with a corresponding example/test file. You can explore the code and run the examples to understand how they work.

To compile and run the code, you can use a C++ compiler such as g++:
